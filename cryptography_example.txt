What else must be kept secret?

Allowed characters to crypt:
alphabet, numbers, ,.!?:-_"'% , blank character, enter key and umlauts, 
but they cannot be imported because python cannot read them from a text file!!! 
But they can be used if you type directly into the input.

Generally every character can be put in code, without any other changes in the code to do.

There are two characters reserved for the functioning of the code.
